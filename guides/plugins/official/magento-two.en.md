## Installation

    This process will explain the installation of the Mercado Pago module via Composer:

**Installation via Composer**

1) Currently available two versions of modules, where each of them will provide a type of checkout:

* If you want to process payments with **Checkout Redirect**, you will need to install version 2.x of the Mercado Pago module. To install this version run the command:

> composer require mercadopago/magento2-plugin:2.*

* If you want to process payments with **Custom Checkout** with Credit Card or Ticket, use version 3.x of the module. This version is optimized for this type of checkout. To install this version run the command:

> composer require mercadopago/magento2-plugin:3.*

2) Then update magento with new modules:

> bin/magento setup:upgrade

3) Execute the command to clean the Magento cache:

> bin/magento cache:clean

4) When the store is in **productive** mode, it is necessary to generate the static files again:

> bin/magento setup:static-content:deploy

5) If you have problems with folder permission when accessing the store, you must renew the permissions:

> chmod 777 -R var/ pub/ generated/

6) Very Good! The module of Mercado Pago was successfully installed.
